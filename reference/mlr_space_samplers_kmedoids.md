# K-Medoids Space Sampler

K-medoids-style pool sampler based on an arbitrary
[ALDistance](https://celecx.mlr-org.com/reference/ALDistance.md).

Medoids are selected from the candidate pool using a greedy build step
followed by swap-based local improvement. The optimization target is the
sum of distances to the nearest selected medoid.

If `known_pool` is given, those points are treated as fixed medoids and
the selected pool points are optimized to complement them.

Creates a new k-medoids space sampler.

## Format

[R6::R6Class](https://r6.r-lib.org/reference/R6Class.html) object
inheriting from
[SpaceSamplerDistance](https://celecx.mlr-org.com/reference/SpaceSamplerDistance.md).

## Arguments

- distance:

  ([ALDistance](https://celecx.mlr-org.com/reference/ALDistance.md))  
  Distance used for the medoid objective.

## Construction

    clx_sps("kmedoids")

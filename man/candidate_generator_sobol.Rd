\title{Sobol Candidate Generator}
\usage{
candidate_generator_sobol()
}
\value{
A candidate generator function.
}
\description{
Generates candidates using Sobol quasi-random sequences, which have
even better space-filling properties than LHS for low discrepancy.
}
\details{
Sobol sequences are deterministic and provide excellent coverage.
However, they're designed for continuous spaces; categorical variables
are handled by discretizing.

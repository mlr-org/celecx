\title{Codomain Helpers for Active Learning}
\description{
Helper functions for working with codomains that include the "learn" tag
for active learning, in addition to bbotk's standard "minimize"/"maximize" tags.
}
\details{
As of bbotk >= 0.9.0, the \link[bbotk:Codomain]{bbotk::Codomain} class natively supports "learn" tags.
These helper functions provide convenient accessors for filtering targets
by their purpose (optimization vs learning).
}
\section{Tag Semantics}{

\itemize{
\item \strong{"minimize"}: Lower values are better; we seek x that minimizes f(x)
\item \strong{"maximize"}: Higher values are better; we seek x that maximizes f(x)
\item \strong{"learn"}: We want to learn f(x) accurately across the domain; no
optimization direction
}

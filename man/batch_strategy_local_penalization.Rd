\title{Local Penalization Batch Strategy}
\usage{
batch_strategy_local_penalization(bandwidth = 0.1, penalization = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{bandwidth}{(\code{numeric(1)})\cr
Penalization bandwidth. Points within this distance (normalized) of a
selected point have their scores penalized. Default is 0.1 (10\% of domain
range).}

\item{penalization}{(\code{numeric(1)})\cr
How much to worsen scores of nearby points. Added to acquisition score.
Default is Inf (effectively removes nearby candidates).}
}
\value{
A batch strategy function.
}
\description{
After selecting each point, penalizes nearby candidates before selecting
the next. Encourages spatial diversity in the batch.
}
\details{
Algorithm:
\enumerate{
\item Select the best candidate
\item Penalize scores of candidates within \code{bandwidth} of the selected point
\item Select the next best (from penalized scores)
\item Repeat until batch is complete
}

Distance is computed using Gower distance (handles mixed types).
